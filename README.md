## Shopaholic Developer Program manifest

Participation in the Shopaholic Developer Program, hereinafter referred to as the Program, is open and voluntary for all parties and can be terminated unilaterally by any party at any time.

Each participant directs their efforts to develop the Shopaholic project, hereinafter the Project, by supporting its advertising, marketing, information and other activities; contributing to the open source code of existing Project products; creating new products (plugins, themes, etc.) for the Project ecosystem with the aim of their subsequent distribution through the official marketplace octobercms.com and other sites. Any other actions aimed directly or indirectly at increasing the value of the Project for the community, as well as improving its reputation and popularity are also encouraged.

All participants receive equal access to promotion and marketing support of their own products for the Project ecosystem, and on their part guarantee the use of the provided unified partner identity, as well as participation in all joint marketing campaigns.

All participants discuss issues related to the Project and / or Program openly and transparently, and promptly exchange information that can directly or indirectly affect them.

All participants show respect for each other, as well as for the Project, therefore, in order to avoid conflicts of interest, they promptly and openly declare their intentions to develop a new product for the ecosystem.

Each participant understands and accepts the technical and other requirements and standards used by the Project, and therefore voluntarily, prior to the official release of their own product based on it, provides the opportunity to implement Code Review with the obligation to subsequently eliminate all noted deficiencies.
